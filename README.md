# CRISPRFlow
A CRISPR-assisted recombineering workFlow for high throughput genome editing in bacteria. The workflow consists of computational and laboratory parts. Here you can find 
all relevant information for the computational parts: 
1. Design of sgRNA-insert pairs
2. Data processing and visualization
